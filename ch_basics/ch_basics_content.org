**** Plans for this chapter 


- Transporting data by signals
- Exchange of data between peers that
  - can directly exchange signals
    - and need to *duplex* a *channel* to realize both directions
    - need to *share* a channel by *multiplexing*
    - possibly have to create that channel across intermediate entities
      (*circuit switching*)
  - cannot directly exchange data but need the help of intermediate
    entities that can store data (*packet switching*)
- *Routing* and *forwarding*
- *Control plane* vs *data plane* 
- Dependability issues 




** Internet in ten minutes                                         :noexport:

**** Internet design choices

** Exchanging data

*** Information, data 

**** Two core use cases 

What happens when \dots 
1. you type \url{https://hpi.de} into a browser
   window?
2. you make a phone call? 

\pause 
- What is the  same?
- What is different?

  - In this sense, a human-oriented term
- Data
  - A formalized representation of facts, concepts, ideas, descriptions, …

**** Wires store data 

What happens in the first $d$ seconds after start of transmission? 

- First bit just about arrives at receiver 
- We are still sending
- Bits are *in flight*, *stored in the wire* 

\pause 
How many? 
\pause 
- In time $d$, sending at rate $r$, $n_\mathrm{in flight} = d \cdot r$
  bits are in flight
- Example: Optical transatlantic link 
  - Data rate $r \approx$ = 30 Gbit/s; distance = 6000 km; $v \approx$ 200.000
    km/s (compare e.g. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAT-14][TAT-14]])
\pause 
\[
n_\mathrm{in flight} = d \cdot r =  \frac{\mathrm{distance}}{v} \cdot
r \approx \frac{6000\,\mathrm{km}}{200.000 \mathrm{km/s}} \cdot 30\,\mathrm{Gbit/s} = 0,9 \mathrm{Gbit}
\]

** Direct exchange

**** Scenario for direct connection 

Let's assume: 

- Two entities $A$ and $B$
- Directly connected by some *physical medium* that can transport signals
  - E.g., copper wires, optical fibre, air, \dots
  - Details do not matter for this section 

*** One-way 

**** Scenario: $A$ transmits to $B$ 

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node [client] (a) {A}; 
\node [client,right=2cm of a] (b) {B}; 
\draw [thick, -{Straight Barb[scale=2]}] (a) -- (b); 
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\pause 
Questions:
- What signal to use? How to map bits to signal?  
\pause 
- When does one bit start, end? 
\pause 
- Endless stream of bits, or finite message? 
  - Rules for starting, ending a message



*** Duplexing 

**** Scenario: $A$, $B$ transmit to each other 

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node [client] (a) {A}; 
\node [client,right=2cm of a] (b) {B}; 
\draw [thick, {Straight Barb[scale=2]}-{Straight Barb[scale=2]}] (a) -- (b); 
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\pause 

Options: 

1. Separate physical medium per direction
   - *\gls{simplex}* use
   - E.g., two pairs of copper wire; two optical fibres
   - Often, too expensive! 
\pause 
2. Shared physical medium for both directions 


**** Sharing a medium: half-duplex

- But role of transmitter changes!

**** Dividing time 

- We have been dividing time to realize half-duplex operation
- So-called *time-division duplexing* (*\gls{tdd}*)

\pause

- Rotated to make it easier to display
- We ignore latency here

**** Simultaneous transmission? 

What if both $A$, $B$ want to transmit at the same time? 
- Called *\gls{full-duplex}* operation 
\pause 


- Problem: $A$'s transmission would arrive at $B$ while $B$ transmits
  itself
\pause 
- Possible consequences
  - $B$ is not receiving, only transmitting: Pointless!
  - $B$ is receiving, but would receive mix of $A$'s and $B$'s signal
    \rightarrow not obvious this works
    - Called *\gls{interference}* 
\pause 
- Problem really is: How to *send and receive* at the same time? 

**** Options to simultaneously transmit and receive? 

- Use different physical media
  - E.g., two different optical fibres
- Use different *parts* of the *same* physical medium
  - E.g., different frequency bands
- Don't do it, fake it! 


**** Example: Full-duplexing by frequency division 

- Give a certain frequency range to each transmitter
- Technically, feasible (but not trivial) to transmit in one range,
  receive in another 
- Called *\gls{fdd}*
  - Usually, but not exclusively used for full-duplex operation

**** Faking simultaneously transmitting and receiving              :noexport:


Suppose: 
- $A$, $B$ want to send each other data at a rate $r$
- We have a half-duplex TDD medium capable setup with rate $2r$ 

Idea: 
- *Buffer* at $A$, $B$ to create *illusion* of full-duplex! 
- When $A$ waits its turn: buffer fills at rate $r$
- When $B$ sends: buffer fills with rate $r$ *and drains* with rate
  $2r$ = drains with rate $r$

**** From medium to channel

In faked operation: 
- $A$, $B$ see a full-duplex operation
- But it is not the actual physical medium that does that 
- We created a *logical abstraction*, a *channel* with the desired
  behavior 

\pause 

***** Channel                                                  :B_definition:
      :PROPERTIES:
      :BEAMER_env: definition
      :END:

A (communication) *\gls{channel}* is 
- a *physical channel*: collection of resources needed to transmit
  (location, physical medium, time, frequency band, and possibly code)
- a *logical channel*: an abstraction of communication with desired
  properties 

**** Notes 

- *Channel* is not the same as *frequency band* 
- *Virtualization* is not a correct term here
  - *Virtualize*: Fake *more of the same* 
  - *Abstract*: Fake *different, more but not necessarily more* 
\pause 
- We will later describe that as *service* vs *protocol*
  - Here: $A$, $B$ require a full-duplex service, which is provided by
    a protocol comprising buffers and half-duplex channel 

**** Protocol 

***** \Gls{protocol}                                           :B_definition:
      :PROPERTIES:
      :BEAMER_env: definition
      :END:

\Glsdesc{protocol}

**** Summary: Key takeaways from duplexing 

- We can change characteristics of a communication channel
  - E.g., $A$, $B$ can use a full-duplex channel that does not really
    exist, but is created out of buffers and a half-duplex channel 
- Buffering is a key technique 


**** Summary: Duplexing terms 

***** Duplexing options                                        :B_definition:
      :PROPERTIES:
      :BEAMER_env: definition
      :END:

\gls{duplexing} describes how two communicating entities can exchange
data *with each other* 

Typical options: 

1. *Simplex*: Communication over a channel only in a single
   direction
2. *Half-duplex*: A channel is shared between two entities,
   taking turns as transmitter and receivers
3. *Full-duplex*: A channel is shared between two entities; 
   both are allowed to use the channel at the same time to send each
   other data
   1. Conceptually, we create two simplex channels out of one full-duplex channel 


*** Multiplexing 

**** Multiple devices? 

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node [client] (a) {A}; 
\node [client,below=1cm of a] (b) {B}; 
\node [client,right=3cm of a] (c) {C}; 
\node [client,right=3cm of b] (d) {D}; 

\coordinate (tmp) at ([xshift=1cm,yshift=-1cm]a.east); 
\coordinate (tmp2) at ([xshift=2cm,yshift=-1cm]a.east); 
\draw [thick] (a.east) -| (tmp) |- (b.east); 
\draw [thick] (c.east) -| (tmp2) |- (d.east); 
\draw [thick] (tmp)  -- (tmp2); 
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\vfill 

What happens when multiple devices share a physical medium? 
- E.g., connected to the same (pair of) copper wire, wireless in vicinity? 

\pause 

Can we reuse some insights from duplexing? 

\pause

channel between *different pairs* of communication partners. It makes
no statements about how to duplex within a pair!

#+NAME: fig:mux:fdm
[[./standalone/multiplexing.pdf]]


**** Combining duplexing, multiplexing 

Duplexing and multiplexing can be +/- arbitrarily combined 
- All four natural combinations make sense 
- Figure \ref{fig:mux:fdm:tdd} shows FDM and TDD as example 

#+caption: Example: Combination of FDM and TDD

[[./standalone/multiplexing.pdf]]

**** Notes on combining duplexing, multiplexing 

- Nothing needs to be fixed or static
  - E.g., time slot length can differ across frequency bands, over
    time, \dots 
- But for simplicity, often is aligned 



** Indirect exchange


*** Network structures

*** Circuit switching 


**** Switches 


- Indirect data exchange necessitates devices between end systems
- Let's call them *switches* for the moment
  - (Will become more precise later)

**** What do switches do? 

Option 1: A switch creates a physical medium 
- along which a signal can travel from transmitter to receiver 
- only by means of physics 
- Example: close a circuit between two cables

**** Circuit switching: Pros and cons 

***** Advantages 

- Conceptually simple 
- Once circuit is established, *no need* to share resources of the
  circuit
  - Performance is easy to predict 

\pause 

***** Disadvantages 

- Can take a long time to create, destroy circuit
- Once circuit is established, *no possibility* to share resources of
  the circuit
  - Even if circuit is not used for actual transmission!
  - Especially bad with *bursty traffic*
  - Circuit needs to be dimensioned for *peak rate*; is idle in
    between

\Glsdesc{bursty}




*** Packet switching 

**** Dealing with bursty traffic 

- Bursty traffic is a consequence of Internet usage models
  - It did not exist in telephony networks! 
- Option 2a: Put a buffer at the transmitter
  - Then, dimension circuit for *average* rate instead of *peak* rate
  - Similar to faking full-duplex over faster half-duplex 
  - Price to pay? \onslide<2->\textbf{Latency}!

\onslide<3->
- Option 2b: Buffer not only at transmitter? 

**** Option 2b: Idea of packet switching

- Do *not* provide a circuit between originator and destination
- Instead:
  - Circuits only between directly adjacent switches and end
    nodes
  - Packet switches have buffer
    - Note: Circuit switches don't! 
  - Group data into groups of bytes - a *packet*
  - A packet carries (at least) data about its destination - an
    *address*
    - An example of *meta data* 


**** A packet switch: simplest version 


Simplest perspective: 
- Packet switch is just memory
- with *interfaces* to channels, directly
  connected to adjacent nodes 

#+caption: A packet switch conceived of as memory with in/outgoing channels

#+NAME: fig:basics:packet_just_memory
[[./standalone/switching.pdf]]


**** Forwarding 
Lacking a physical medium stretching from one end of the other, 
- *receive* the packet at an incoming interface 
\pause 
- we need to *store* a packet inside the switch, then 
\pause 
- *forward* it on the outgoing interface

**** Channels in packet switching 

- *Physical* channel: Between interface at a switch and adjacent
  device 
\pause 
- *Logical* channel (for the four-end devices, one-switch example from
  above): Created out of 
  - two physical channels (e.g., A-Switch and Switch-D)
    - No signal travels from A to D! 
  - resources in the switch (e.g., buffer space)
  - the process of *forwarding* packets 
\pause 
- Logical channel generalizes to bigger setups! 













**** Packet switching: Pros and cons 

***** Advantages 

- Easy to share physical channels 
- Deals well with bursty traffic
- No setup phase necessary before data is sent 

\pause 

***** Disadvantages 

- Every packet has overhead (meta data)
- Intermediate devices need buffers
- Store-and-forward adds latency from source to destination 
- Very hard to give guarantees on latency, data rate 



**** A packet switch: Buffers at the interfaces 

More details: 
- Add some buffer to interfaces 
- To store a *partial* packet while it is being received from/transmitted to neighbor

  interface

*** Packet switching control 

**** Access to a shared medium 

- Suppose we multiplex a physical medium
  - TDM, FDM, \dots  @@latex: \textemdash @@  does not matter
- We need to control access to the medium
  - Typical goal: at most one signal arrives at a receiver within the used
    multiplexing option 
- Challenge: which entities are affected by transmission; which do
  share a physical medium?
  - Usually obvious in wired media; very difficult in wireless media
- Details later (Chapter \ref{ch:mac}): \gls{mac}


**** Finding routes 

- Forwarding needs to know the next hop for a given destination

*** Circuit switching control 
\label{sec:basics:control:circuit}

**** Circuit setup 

Needs:  
\pause 
- Source and destination 
- Required parameters: minimum data rate, maximum acceptable latency
- Routing tables
  - Can reuse ideas from packet switching routing protocols 
- Confirmation that it is done 
\pause 
- some means to tell neighbors that a circuit is to be set up
  - Weird???
  - but feasible, since these are only neighbors talking with each
    other directly!
    - Hence, no switching involved! 

**** Circuit teardown 

At end of circuit usage: destroy circuit 
- so that resources can be used again 




**** Circuit setup and teardown: MSC

** Errors 

**** Things go wrong 
- So we are done building a network  @@latex: \textemdash @@  unless something goes wrong!
- Source of errors/abnormal situations
  - Conversion from signals to bits can fail
  - Access to a shared medium might not work
  - Packets can be lost, e.g., because buffers overflow
  - Packets can be misrouted (because of incorrect routing tables), delayed, reordered
  - Receiver might not be able to keep up with incoming stream of packets
  - Routers can fail, resulting in incorrect routing tables
  - \dots and many more 


**** Error control 
- Error control at various abstraction levels needed
- Between two direct neighbors, over a given connection
- Between end systems, to compensate for errors not detected locally  @@latex: \textemdash @@  e.g., incorrect order of packets

**** Overload control
- Protect the network against buffer overflows, regulate the number of packets injected into the network – Congestion control
- Protect end system against too many packets coming in  @@latex: \textemdash @@  Flow control

**** How? 

- *Where* and *how* to implement error and overload control is a principal architectural decision
- Main options: in the end system or in the network
- Big difference between telephony system and Internet
- Telephony carriers are (traditionally) interested in network-based
  solutions to be able to charge for it

**** Intermediate summary: Basic required functions
- Bit-to-signal and signal-to-bit conversion
- Grouping bits into packets
- Accessing a shared medium
- Switching, duplexing, multiplexing
- Controlling errors on a connection between two systems
- Forwarding incoming packets, consulting routing tables
- Constructing routing tables, maintaining them
